Create Joints
Orient Joints
	Values in middle joint Z OK
	0 in X, Y
Create IK Handle
	Root->"Wrist"
	Choose Preferred Angle (direction of elbow bend)
Create Controls
	Groups for Orientation, Ctrls for Animation
	(Arm IK, Shoulder IK, Arm PV)
	Orient PV Ctrl to the Elbow
	Create Offset Group (arm_pv_ctrl_grp, arm_pv_offset_grp, arm_pv_ctrl)

At this point, you can orient the controls and freeze them .

Constrain Controls
	Arm_PV_ctrl gets a pole vector constraint to the IK Handle
		This control can be oriented correctly by matching transformations to the elbow.
	Shoulder_IK_ctrl to the Shoulder (or root) joint
	Make the Arm_IK_Handle a child of the Arm_IK_ctrl

For Wrist
	Grp-IKCtrl-IKHandle(hidden)
For Elbow
	CtrlGrp(orient to elbow)-OrientGrp(moved away from elbow in one value)-Ctrl

Rotate elbow to see which value changes in which sign = preferred angle
If you give the control an ORIENT constraint on the hand, it will allow the ik control to also rotate the wrist


Make Granddaddy Controls
Make Transform_ctrl and group and COG_ctrl and group at origin

COG is for center of gravity (or stays at origin)

Shoulder Joint can have translation values but no rotation

Joints can have translation in only one axis, in our class X
All Controls must be zeroed out, groups can have values
