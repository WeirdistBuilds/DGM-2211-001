	Create a character rig for the included character using IK systems for the limbs. Each system must include a control for the IK handle, a base control for the root joint, and a pole vector control. The remaining portions of the rig (spine, hip, head, hands, fingers, transform, cog, etc.) will be rigged using standard FK systems.
	Incorporate the IK systems into the rig and ensure that all systems function properly together. Conform to the naming and organization conventions that have been established.
	Upon completion of the rig, create a walk or run cycle using the principles of animation presented in Animator's Survival Kit. Use the text and references in establishing the key poses of the animation. Apply problem-solving in creating the rig and creativity in the animation.
Grading will be based on completion, competency, problem-solving, and accuracy.
	Upload the completed animation to Sketchfab, or to YouTube as a Playblast, and submit the URL and the character rig Maya file (.ma) to the assignment.

Constraints take priority over hierarchy

SO Constraints will go from Spine or Root Jnt to the IK Base Ctrl Groups


If you mirror joints, do behavioural flip and mirror across if |yx_, you'll do yz.

Orienting joints
	x moving to next joint, or maybe adjusted depending on situation.
	z acts as a PIN for the joint, if rotate forward is important, forward must be positive z
	matching tip joints to rotation can also be done by zeroing out joint orient values in the attribute editor (or wherever)

if x is down joint and z points world down, y is going the direction positive z will rotate.
